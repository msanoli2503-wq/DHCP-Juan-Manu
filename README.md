# üñß PROJECT DHCP 

## üìå OBJECTIVE(READ DOC.MD FOR MORE INFORMATION) 

The objective of this practice is to configure a DHCP server on a Linux machine and two clients that obtain their network configuration automatically:

c1 receives an IP address dynamically from the configured DHCP pool.

c2 receives a fixed IP address based on its MAC address.

This setup is fully automated using Vagrant and provisioning scripts, making the lab reproducible and easy to deploy.
